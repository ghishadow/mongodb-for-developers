mongo-shell <----> mongod <----> http server ( python, pymongo, ) <----> User (Router, Laptop)



We will do our practical in [[https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd][lxd]] container, to install it in Ubuntu
run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ snap install lxd
#+END_SRC
then add your user to lxd group, so you don't need to run as sudo
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ sudo usermod -a -G lxd <yourusername>
#+END_SRC
Before you can create containers, you need to tell LXD a little bit about your storage and network needs.
so run the following command to setup that

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ sudo lxd init
#+END_SRC

now lxd has been setup, we can create our lxc container by running

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 <containername> 

#+END_SRC
